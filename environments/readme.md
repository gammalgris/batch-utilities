This directory contains several scripts which are supposed to set up a
clean console environment on windows systems.

The scripts were created for misconfigured systems and/ or systems where
too much legacy software is installed. Another potential cause of error
on such systems is the PATH environment variable. Too many useless or
redundant entries (e.g. multiple java installations) will lead to
avoidable errors.
